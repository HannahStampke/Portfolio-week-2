Assignment 2 - Personal Portfolio Page.

In this assignment, a webpage was required which displayed several key items for possible employer beenfits.
The key elements were:
- An updated image of the student
- An 'about me' section
- A 'highlighted and previous works' section
- A "contact me' section
- A navigation panel at the top linking to all of these sections.

The highlighted content required an image and a link that went to the live site in which the work resided.

The navigation links needed to scroll the user down the page to the selected section.

The contact section required working links that sent the user to the selected website.

The CSS had to be organised with commentary and include:
- Flexboxes
- Media Queries

The HTML had to be organised and include:
- alt tags
- a linked image
- semantic framing
- correct structure

With reference to the prior weeks activities, this webpage was designed with a playful layout and colour scheme in mind.
The images were the hardest part of this assignment. They did not want to be wrangled into their boxes.

Thank you for your time and patience, I hope you enjoy.
